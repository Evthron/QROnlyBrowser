# QROnlyBrowser
A android browser that can only access internet by scanning QR code.

To minimize my screen time, I don't have browser installed on my phone. This caused me some trouble when eating out since restaurants now often require customers to order by phone. I made this app to solve my problem.

This app doesn't allow cross domain navigation by clicking links.
