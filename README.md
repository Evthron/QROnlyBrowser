# QROnlyBrowser
A android browser that can only access internet by scanning QR code using WebView.

To minimize my screen time, I don't have browser installed on my phone. This cause me some trouble when eating out since many restaurants require customers to order by phone now. I made this app to solve my problem.

This app blocks cross-domain navigation when users click on links.
